We are excited to share that FUNGI-NL held its first consortium meeting online on April 7, 2025, marking an important milestone in building our collaborative community.

Partners from leading Dutch research institutes and organizations active in fungal biology, bioinformatics, and data stewardship joined the meeting to discuss the project idea and initial plans. FUNGI-NL aims to create a national fungal research platform built around four integrated hubs—Data, Software, Training, and Community—to streamline research, ensure FAIR compliance, and foster sustainable collaboration.

This first meeting allowed the consortium to align on priorities, share expertise, and explore opportunities for collaboration. It also reinforced our commitment to building an inclusive, FAIR-compliant, and long-term sustainable fungal research ecosystem.

We look forward to future meetings, workshops, and collaborative activities as FUNGI-NL continues to grow and engage the broader fungal research community.
