## About FUNGI-NL

FUNGI(FAIR, Users, Networks, Genomics, Infrastructure)-NL is a national initiative that connects fungal research, data, software, and training into a single, FAIR-compliant ecosystem. As fungal datasets, tools, and expertise rapidly expand across institutions, FUNGI-NL provides the structure needed to make them accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

By integrating curated fungal data, open and well-documented software, targeted training, and a strong research network, FUNGI-NL supports reproducible science and collaboration across disciplines. The platform builds on existing expertise and infrastructures in the Netherlands and aligns with national and international initiatives in open science and data stewardship.

FUNGI-NL aims to empower researchers, students, and institutions by lowering technical barriers, harmonizing standards, and fostering a sustainable, collaborative community for fungal research—now and in the future.
