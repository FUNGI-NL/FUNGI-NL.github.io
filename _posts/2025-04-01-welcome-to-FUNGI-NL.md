## Welcome to FUNGI-NL

We are pleased to welcome you to FUNGI-NL, a national initiative designed to strengthen fungal research in the Netherlands through FAIR data, open software, training, and community building.

Inspired by the TDCC-LSH calls and coordinated by the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute, FUNGI-NL is developed in close collaboration with leading Dutch research institutes and partners active in fungal biology, bioinformatics, and data stewardship, and aligns with national and international open science initiatives.

As fungal datasets, tools, and expertise continue to expand across institutions, FUNGI-NL brings them together in a shared, FAIR-compliant platform. Our goal is to make fungal data and resources easier to find, access, reuse, and build upon, supporting reproducible research and cross-disciplinary collaboration.

Building on existing infrastructures and expertise, FUNGI-NL addresses the domain-specific needs of fungal research through curated data, reusable software, targeted training, and an active research network. Together, these elements form a sustainable and inclusive ecosystem for fungal research.

This website will serve as a central hub for project updates, resources, events, and opportunities to get involved. We invite researchers, students, developers, and partners to join us as FUNGI-NL grows.

Welcome—and stay tuned!
