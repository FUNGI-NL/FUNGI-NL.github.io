## Welcome to FUNGI-NL

We are excited to welcome you to FUNGI-NL, an initiative dedicated to strengthening fungal research in the Netherlands through FAIR data, open software, training, and community building.

As fungal datasets, tools, and expertise continue to grow across institutions, FUNGI-NL brings them together in a shared, FAIR-compliant platform. Our goal is to make fungal data and resources easier to find, access, reuse, and build upon—supporting reproducible research and collaboration across disciplines.

FUNGI-NL builds on existing infrastructures and expertise, while addressing the domain-specific needs of fungal research. Through curated data, reusable software, targeted training, and an active research network, we aim to foster a sustainable and inclusive fungal research ecosystem.

This website will serve as a central hub for project updates, resources, events, and opportunities to get involved. We invite researchers, students, developers, and partners to join us as we grow FUNGI-NL together.

Welcome—and stay tuned!
