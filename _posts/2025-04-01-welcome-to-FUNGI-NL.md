## Welcome to FUNGI-NL

We are excited to welcome you to FUNGI-NL, a national initiative dedicated to strengthening fungal research in the Netherlands through FAIR data, open software, training, and community building.

As fungal datasets, tools, and expertise continue to grow across institutions, FUNGI-NL brings them together in a shared, FAIR-compliant platform. Our goal is to make fungal data and resources easier to find, access, reuse, and build upon—supporting reproducible research and collaboration across disciplines.

FUNGI-NL is developed in close collaboration with leading Dutch research institutes and partners active in fungal biology, bioinformatics, and data stewardship, and aligns with national and international open science initiatives. Building on existing infrastructures and expertise, FUNGI-NL also addresses the domain-specific needs of fungal research.

Through curated data, reusable software, targeted training, and an active research network, FUNGI-NL aims to foster a sustainable and inclusive fungal research ecosystem.

This website will serve as a central hub for project updates, resources, events, and opportunities to get involved. We invite researchers, students, developers, and partners to join us as we grow FUNGI-NL together.

Welcome—and stay tuned!
