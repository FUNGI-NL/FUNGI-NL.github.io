The FUNGI-NL consortium met to discuss TDCC-LSH reviewers' feedback on the proposal. 

We appreciate the reviewers' recoginition for the project’s relevance, uniqueness, and potential to become a national hub for FAIR fungal research in theNetherlands.

Based on these valuable comments, we will proactively approach relevant stakeholds to expand FUNGI-NL's user community, 
further refine inclusion criteria for data and tools, 
and clearly define governance and collaboration structures. An in-person consortium meeting is planned for early July 2025 to finalize work packages,
identify priority data and tools for the platform, agree on in-kind contributions, and prepare the next phase of the proposal.

These steps will ensure that FUNGI-NL remains community-driven, well-coordinated, and positioned for long-term impact in data-driven fungal research.
