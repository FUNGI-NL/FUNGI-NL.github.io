We are excited to share that FUNGI-NL held its first consortium meeting online on April 7, 2025. This marked an important milestone in building our collaborative community and shaping the project’s direction.

During the meeting, partners from leading Dutch research institutes and organizations active in fungal biology, bioinformatics, and data stewardship came together to discuss the project idea, key objectives, and initial plans for FAIR data integration, software development, and training activities.

This first gathering allowed us to align on priorities, share expertise, and explore opportunities for collaboration across the consortium. It also reinforced our commitment to creating a sustainable, inclusive, and FAIR-compliant fungal research ecosystem.

We look forward to future meetings, workshops, and collaborative activities as FUNGI-NL continues to grow and engage the broader fungal research community.

Stay tuned for updates and opportunities to get involved!
