We are thrilled to share that FUNGI-NL held its first in-person consortium meeting on June 24, 2025, at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. This was an exciting milestone for the project, bringing together partners, researchers, and stakeholders to strengthen collaboration and move the initiative forward.

During the meeting, participants discussed progress since the first online meetings, shared updates on data, software, and training resources, and explored the next steps for building the FUNGI-NL platform. Special attention was given to coordinating the four integrated hubs—Data, Software, Training, and Community—to ensure seamless collaboration and FAIR compliance.

The face-to-face format fostered dynamic discussions, knowledge exchange, and stronger connections across the consortium, reinforcing FUNGI-NL’s commitment to building a sustainable and inclusive fungal research ecosystem.
